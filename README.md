# vg100-s1-fa23-group11-programs

Work with Arduino UNO and SIPEED maixduino(just see details in the proposal and poster).

Main purpose of these codes is to connect 'esp32' with 'k210' on the Maixduino, to apply our vision model on k210 and its camera, to connect app on the phone, arduino UNO and Maixduino via Bluetooth, and to control the stepping motor by Maixduino on Micropython.

see our project in the fa23 design expo in Longbin Building, UM-SJTU JI， Dec. 13th, 2023.

Always trying to make this not-so-good story what we want it to be!————Kiana
